You separate people into groups and\nmake them hate one another so you can run them all.\nAt the time, black South Africans outnumbered white\nSouth Africans nearly five to one, yet we were divided into\ndifferent tribes with different languages: Zulu, Xhosa,\nTswana, Sotho, Venda, Ndebele, Tsonga, Pedi, and more.\nLong before apartheid existed these tribal factions clashed\nand warred with one another. Then white rule used that\nanimosity to divide and conquer. All nonwhites were\nsystematically classified into various groups and subgroups.\nThen these groups were given differing levels of rights and\nprivileges in order to keep them at odds.\nPerhaps the starkest of these divisions was between\nSouth Africa’s two dominant groups, the Zulu and the\nXhosa. The Zulu man is known as the warrior. He is proud.\nHe puts his head down and fights. When the colonial armies\ninvaded, the Zulu charged into battle with nothing but\nspears and shields against men with guns. The Zulu were\nslaughtered by the thousands, but they never stopped\nfighting. The Xhosa, on the other hand, pride themselves on\nbeing the thinkers. My mother is Xhosa. Nelson Mandela\nwas Xhosa. The Xhosa waged a long war against the white\nman as well, but after experiencing the futility of battle\nagainst a better-armed foe, many Xhosa chiefs took a more\nnimble approach. “These white people are here whether we\nlike it or not,” they said. “Let’s see what tools they possess"

For a long time neither was\nparticularly successful, and each blamed the other for a\nproblem neither had created. Bitterness festered. For\ndecades those feelings were held in check by a common\nenemy. Then apartheid fell, Mandela walked free, and black\nSouth Africa went to war with itself."

Three churches, to be precise.\nThe reason we went to three churches was because\nmy mom said each church gave her something\ndifferent. The first church offered jubilant praise of\nthe Lord. The second church offered deep analysis of\nthe scripture, which my mom loved. The third\nchurch offered passion and catharsis; it was a place\nwhere you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit\ninside you. Completely by coincidence, as we moved\nback and forth between these churches, I noticed\nthat each one had its own distinct racial makeup:\nJubilant church was mixed church. Analytical church\nwas white church. And passionate, cathartic church,\nthat was black church.\nMixed church was Rhema Bible Church. Rhema\nwas one of those huge, supermodern, suburban\nmegachurches. The pastor, Ray McCauley, was an\nex-bodybuilder with a big smile and the personality\nof a cheerleader. Pastor Ray had competed in the\n1974 Mr. Universe competition. He placed third. The\nwinner that year was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every\nweek, Ray would be up onstage working really hard\nto make Jesus cool. There was arena-style seating\nand a rock band jamming out with the latest\nChristian contemporary pop. Everyone sang along,"

If you think\ntoo much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you,\nor the ass-kicking that life gave you, you’ll stop\npushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It’s\nbetter to take it, spend some time crying, then wake\nup the next day and move on. You’ll have a few\nbruises and they’ll remind you of what happened and\nthat’s okay. But after a while the bruises fade, and\nthey fade for a reason—because now it’s time to get\nup to some shit again."

One of\nthe biggest reasons for that, as we know in South Africa, is\nthat only witches have cats, and all cats are witches.\nThere was a famous incident during an Orlando Pirates\nsoccer match a few years ago. A cat got into the stadium and\nran through the crowd and out onto the pitch in the middle\nof the game. A security guard, seeing the cat, did what any\nsensible black person would do. He said to himself, “That cat\nis a witch.” He caught the cat and—live on TV—he kicked it\nand stomped it and beat it to death with a sjambok, a hard\nleather whip.\nIt was front-page news all over the country. White\npeople lost their shit. Oh my word, it was insane. The\nsecurity guard was arrested and put on trial and found guilty\nof animal abuse. He had to pay some enormous fine to avoid\nspending several months in jail. What was ironic to me was\nthat white people had spent years seeing video of black\npeople being beaten to death by other white people, but this\none video of a black man kicking a cat, that’s what sent them\nover the edge. Black people were just confused. They didn’t\nsee any problem with what the man did. They were like,\n“Obviously that cat was a witch. How else would a cat know\nhow to get out onto a soccer pitch? Somebody sent it to jinx\none of the teams. That man had to kill the cat. He was\nprotecting the players.”"

There was the\nthing where you don’t actually talk straight to the\nperson. You have your group of friends and she has\nher group of friends, and your group of friends has to\ngo to her group of friends and say, “Okay, Trevor\nlikes Maylene.

Older houses, but\nstill a nice place to live. In Soweto I was the only white kid in\nthe black township. In Eden Park I was the only mixed kid in\nthe colored area. In Highlands North I was the only black kid\nin the white suburb—and by “only” I mean only. In\nHighlands North the white never took flight. It was a largely\nJewish neighborhood, and Jewish people don’t flee. They’re\ndone fleeing. They’ve already fled. They get to a place, build\ntheir shul, and hold it down. Since the white people around\nus weren’t leaving, there weren’t a lot of families like ours\nmoving in behind us.\nI didn’t make any friends in Highlands North for the\nlongest time. I had an easier time making friends in Eden\nPark, to be honest. In the suburbs, everyone lived behind\nwalls. The white neighborhoods of Johannesburg were built\non white fear—fear of black crime, fear of black uprisings\nand reprisals—and as a result virtually every house sits\nbehind a six-foot wall, and on top of that wall is electric wire."

It went in, came\nout, and didn’t do any real damage. The other bullet\nwent through the back of her head, entering below"

It missed the spinal\ncord by a hair, missed the medulla oblongata, and\ntraveled through her head just underneath the brain,\nmissing every major vein, artery, and nerve. With the\ntrajectory the bullet was on, it was headed straight\nfor her left eye socket and would have blown out her\neye, but at the last second it slowed down, hit her\ncheekbone \ninstead, \nshattered \nher \ncheekbone,\nricocheted off, and came out through her left nostril.\nOn the gurney in the emergency room, the blood had\nmade the wound look much worse than it was. The\nbullet took off only a tiny flap of skin on the side of\nher nostril, and it came out clean, with no bullet\nfragments left inside. She didn’t even need surgery.\nThey stopped the bleeding, stitched her up in back,\nstitched her up in front, and let her heal.\n“There was nothing we can do, because there’s\nnothing we need to do,” the doctor said.\nMy mother was out of the hospital in four days.\nShe was back at work in seven.\n—\nThe doctors kept her sedated the rest of that day and\nnight to rest. They told all of us to go home. “She’s\nstable,” they said. “There’s nothing you can do here.\nGo home and sleep.” So we did."

    "text": "I went back first thing the next morning to be\nwith my mother in her room and wait for her to wake\nup. When I walked in she was still asleep. The back\nof her head was bandaged. She had stitches in her\nface and gauze covering her nose and her left eye.\nShe looked frail and weak, tired, one of the few times\nin my life I’d ever seen her look that way.\nI sat close by her bed, holding her hand, waiting\nand watching her breathe, a flood of thoughts going\nthrough my mind. I was still afraid I was going to\nlose her. I was angry at myself for not being there,\nangry at the police for all the times they didn’t arrest\nAbel. I told myself I should have killed him years\nago, which was ridiculous to think because I’m not\ncapable of killing anyone, but I thought it anyway. I\nwas angry at the world, angry at God. Because all my\nmom does is pray. If there’s a fan club for Jesus, my\nmom is definitely in the top 100, and this is what she\ngets?\nAfter an hour or so of waiting, she opened her\nunbandaged eye. The second she did, I lost it. I\nstarted bawling. She asked for some water and I gave\nher a cup, and she leaned forward a bit to sip\nthrough the straw. I kept bawling and bawling and\nbawling. I couldn’t control myself.\n“Shh,” she said. “Don’t cry, baby. Shhhhh. Don’t"

There is no\nbright side.”\n“Of course there is. Now you’re officially the\nbest-looking person in the family.”\nShe broke out in a huge smile and started\nlaughing. Through my tears, I started laughing, too. I\nwas bawling my eyes out and laughing hysterically at\nthe same time. We sat there and she squeezed my\nhand and we cracked each other up the way we\nalways did, mother and son, laughing together\nthrough the pain in an intensive-care recovery room\non a bright and sunny and beautiful day."

Waiting around at the hospital that day, we\nhad so many unanswered questions, like, What happened to\nIsaac? Where was Isaac? We only found out after we found\nhim and he told us.\nWhen Andrew sped off with my mom, leaving the four-\nyear-old alone on the front lawn, Abel walked over to his\nyoungest, picked him up, put the boy in his car, and drove\naway. As they drove, Isaac turned to his dad.\n“Dad, why did you kill Mom?” he asked, at that point\nassuming, as we all did, that my mom was dead.\n“Because I’m very unhappy,” Abel replied. “Because I’m\nvery sad.”\n“Yeah, but you shouldn’t kill Mom. Where are we going\nnow?”\n“I’m going to drop you off at your uncle’s house.”\n“And where are you going?”\n“I’m going to kill myself.”\n“But don’t kill yourself, Dad.”\n“No, I’m going to kill myself.”\nThe uncle Abel was talking about was not a real uncle but\na friend. He dropped Isaac off with this friend and then he\ndrove off. He spent that day and went to everyone, relatives\nand friends, and said his goodbyes. He even told people what\nhe had done. “This is what I’ve done. I’ve killed her, and I’m"

    "text": "now on the way to kill myself. Goodbye.” He spent the whole\nday on this strange farewell tour, until finally one of his\ncousins called him out.\n“You need to man up,” the cousin said. “This is the\ncoward’s way. You need to turn yourself in. If you were man\nenough to do this, you have to be man enough to face the\nconsequences.”\nAbel broke down and handed his gun over to the cousin,\nthe cousin drove him to the police station, and Abel turned\nhimself in.\nHe spent a couple of weeks in jail, waiting for a bail\nhearing. We filed a motion opposing bail because he’d\nshown that he was a threat. Since Andrew and Isaac were\nstill minors, social workers started getting involved. We felt\nlike the case was open-and-shut, but then one day, after a\nmonth or so, we got a call that he’d made bail. The great\nirony was that he got bail because he told the judge that if he\nwas in jail, he couldn’t earn money to support his kids. But\nhe wasn’t supporting his kids—my mom was supporting the\nkids.\nSo Abel was out. The case slowly ground its way through\nthe legal system, and everything went against us. Because of\nmy mother’s miraculous recovery, the charge was only\nattempted murder. And because no domestic violence\ncharges had ever been filed in all the times my mother had\ncalled the police to report him, Abel had no criminal record.\nHe got a good lawyer, who continued to lean on the court\nabout the fact that he had children at home who needed him.\nThe case never went to trial. Abel pled guilty to attempted\nmurder. He was given three years’ probation. He didn’t\nserve a single day in prison. He kept joint custody of his\nsons. He’s walking around Johannesburg today, completely\nfree. The last I heard he still lives somewhere around\nHighlands North, not too far from my mom."

    "text": "—\nThe final piece of the story came from my mom, who could\nonly tell us her side after she woke up. She remembered\nAbel pulling up and pointing the gun at Andrew. She\nremembered falling to the ground after getting shot in the\nass. Then Abel came and stood over her and pointed his gun\nat her head. She looked up and looked at him straight down\nthe barrel of the gun. Then she started to pray, and that’s\nwhen the gun misfired. Then it misfired again. Then it\nmisfired again, and again. She jumped up, shoved him away,\nand ran for the car. Andrew leapt in beside her and she\nturned the ignition and then her memory went blank.\nTo this day, nobody can explain what happened. Even\nthe police didn’t understand. Because it wasn’t like the gun\ndidn’t work. It fired, and then it didn’t fire, and then it fired\nagain for the final shot. Anyone who knows anything about\nfirearms will tell you that a 9mm handgun cannot misfire in\nthe way that gun did. But at the crime scene the police had\ndrawn little chalk circles all over the driveway, all with spent\nshell casings from the shots Abel fired, and then these four\nbullets, intact, from when he was standing over my mom—\nnobody knows why.\nMy mom’s total hospital bill came to 50,000 rand. I paid\nit the day we left. For four days we’d been in the hospital,\nfamily members visiting, talking and hanging out, laughing\nand crying. As we packed up her things to leave, I was going\non about how insane the whole week had been.\n“You’re lucky to be alive,” I told her. “I still can’t believe\nyou didn’t have any health insurance.”\n“Oh but I do have insurance,” she said.\n“You do?”\n“Yes. Jesus.”\n“Jesus?”"

I don’t pray for\nnothing.”\n“You know,” I said, “for once I cannot argue with you.\nThe gun, the bullets—I can’t explain any of it. So I’ll give you\nthat much.” Then I couldn’t resist teasing her with one last\nlittle jab. “But where was your Jesus to pay your hospital\nbill, hmm? I know for a fact that He didn’t pay that.”\nShe smiled and said, “You’re right. He didn’t. But He\nblessed me with the son who did.”"
